    <center><h1>Animal Poaching Awareness</h1></center>
    <center><h2> What is Animal Poaching?</h2><center>
    <p>Animal poaching is defined as the illegal hunting or capturing of wild animals. Poaching is usually associated with land use rights. According to Encyclopedia Britannica, poaching was originally performed by impoverished peasants for subsistence purposes and a supplement for meager diets.
    <center><h2>Why Should You Care?</h2></center>
    <p>Forest and grasslands that rely on the nutrients brought by essential animals will have trouble finding enough nutrients elsewhere to grow and produce their food;
      therefore, as poaching animals depletes the population of animals, it also puts the plants and environment at risk of extinction.</p>
    <p>Animal poaching is the illegal hunting of animals that are mainly hunted for the valuable features the targeted animals possess.
  Our mission is to educate the ones who aren't aware of the danger that animal poaching is posing on our environment such as the interruption of the food chain.
      We also aim to raise awareness for the challenges that mostly elephants, tigers, and rhinos face.</p>
